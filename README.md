# Project Portfolio: Airline Reviews Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the PortfolioAirlines dataset analysis project! In this project, we explore a rich dataset containing reviews of airline experiences, covering various aspects such as seat comfort, cabin staff service, ground service, and more. The dataset encompasses reviews from diverse routes, seat types, and traveler types, offering a comprehensive view of customer sentiments.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:

- **Aircraft Type:** The type of aircraft used for the flight.
- **Users Reviews:** Detailed reviews from passengers about their experiences.
- **Country:** The country associated with the review.
- **Type of Travelers:** Categorization of travelers (e.g., Solo Leisure, Couple Leisure, Business).
- **Route:** The route of the flight.
- **Seat Types:** The type of seat (e.g., Economy Class, Business Class).
- **Various Ratings:** Ratings provided by users for seat comfort, cabin staff service, ground service, food & beverages, etc.
- **Date Flown:** The date when the flight took place.
- **Recommended:** Whether the user recommends the airline (yes/no).

## Objectives

Our goal is to leverage data science techniques to extract valuable insights and answer interesting questions from this dataset. Some potential avenues for exploration include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Perform sentiment analysis on user reviews to understand overall satisfaction levels.
2. **Factors Influencing Recommendations:** Identify factors that most influence passengers to recommend or not recommend the airline.
3. **Route and Service Analysis:** Analyze the performance of the airline on specific routes and types of services (e.g., ground service, cabin staff).
4. **Aircraft Comparison:** Compare user satisfaction across different aircraft types.
5. **Time Analysis:** Investigate whether user satisfaction has changed over time.

## Interesting Questions to Answer

1. **Which features are most correlated with positive/negative reviews?**
2. **Do certain routes or aircraft types receive consistently higher ratings?**
3. **Are there specific time periods associated with increased satisfaction or dissatisfaction?**
4. **What are the common reasons behind users recommending or not recommending the airline?**
5. **Can we predict user recommendations based on other features in the dataset?**
